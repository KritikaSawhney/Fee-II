    <b>Author: Colleen Hoover</b><br>
    <b>Publish Date: 29 February 2016</b><br>

    It Ends with Us by Colleen Hoover has to be one of my favorite romance books of all time. It Ends with Us is a book that follows a girl named Lily who has just moved and is ready to start her life after college. Lily then meets a guy named Ryle and she falls for him. As she is developing feelings for Ryle, Atlas, her first love, reappears and challenges the relationship between Lily and Ryle. After reading the book, I rate It Ends with Us 5 stars. This book is a 5-star worthy book because it did not fall into the same repetitive trap as other romance books commonly do. I have noticed from reading lots of romance books that there is the same basic plot in almost every single one, and this book did not have that, which was really refreshing. Something that I really appreciated within this book was the powerful and impactful message that is normally not discussed. I did not expect to be impacted and touched by the book as much as I did. I also really loved how Lily’s character was portrayed in the book. The amount of strength that Lily shows throughout the book is truly inspiring. This story is told only from Lily’s perspective and I loved this aspect. It Ends with Us really allows you to experience and feel everything that Lily goes through and it makes for a gut-wrenching book that will make you laugh, smile, and cry. Lastly, this book gets 5 stars from me because of how complex and deep the plot and the characters were. The story dives in and explores the grey area of things and shows how life is not purely black and white. The book was constantly surprising me and I never wanted to put the book down. Overall, this book is not only one of the best romance books that I have read, but one of the best books I have ever read in general. I highly recommend reading It Ends with Us and I’m sure you will give it 5 stars too.
    Sometimes it is the one who loves you who hurts you the most.

Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up — she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.

Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.

As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan — her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.

After having read Verity, my friend suggested this other one by the same author, citing that it was also very good. I overall quite enjoyed this book! It may not be for everyone, but I definitely enjoyed the story and the twists that came with it. It’s kind of a romance book, but in my opinion it’s also quite the thriller. After reading this I’m not surprised at all that the author was able to write Verity.

It Ends With Us is the story of Lily, who has a rough childhood and is forced to navigate adulthood quite isolated. On her journey to success, she meets the neurosurgeon Ryle, who turns her life around in more than one way. Ryle has a “no dating” rule, which intrigues Lily. This book follows the journey of Lily as she navigates romance, business, exes, and (TW) abuse.It Ends with Us is a romance story that also classifies in my opinion as a type of pseudo-thriller. Lily, a child with a lonely past, navigates adulthood and work life as she faces difficulties in her present and from her past. She meets Ryle early on, who is attractive but seems to be emotionally unavailable

    <b>Author: Franz Kafka</b><br>
    <b>Publish Date: November 1919</b><br>
    The Castle, Kafka’s final unfinished novel, is surreal and fantastic and somehow…aggressively boring. Like some bizarre inversion of a fairy tale, the fantastical elements only further contribute to the oppressive feeling of tedium that marks each page. It is a book in which so many things happen, and so few of them matter. I understand that this part of the effect that Kafka is trying to produce and that there is probably no better way that can avoid this problem, but that does not make it any easier on the reader.

    Even the organization of the pages seems calculated to produce as much fatigue as possible. I’ve been reading through a textbook on Technical Writing and finding out about various tips and tricks used to help readers engage with the information so that communication can be as smooth and effective as possible, but The Castle breaks all of these. Almost every sentence is a bloated morass of modifying phrases, asides, and comma-splices. Paragraphs go on for pages. Dialogue is left clumped together without even the relief of a line-break. Each page is an unbroken block of text.
    
    Kafka’s protagonist, K., arrives in a village late a night, having been requested by the count of the castle for his services as a land surveyor. After his long journey, he goes to the inn and asks to be allowed to collapse and rest in one dark corner of the building. But no sooner has he closed his eyes than his troubles begin. A young man claiming to be a representative of the castle informs K. that he is not allowed to rest anywhere inside the village limits without a permit from the castle.
    
    “Well, I’ll have to go and get a permit then,” responds K.. So begins his doomed attempt to reach the castle. At every step, he is thwarted by the unseen complexity of situation, a complexity which seems to have no bottom and which he therefore can never master enough to secure even his simple goal.
    
    While Camus in his Myth of Sisyphus claims there is some great distinction between the inhuman bureaucracy of The Trial and that of The Castle, I’m not sure that I can join him in this belief. It is clear that the castle represents something closer to the divine than the hideously dysfunctional legal system that is presented in The Trial, but I’m not sure that, as Camus suggests, Kafka was intending to show that the answer to the dilemma was something like a Kierkegaardian leap of faith. I simply don’t get that from the text. Where the castle does seem to be something than more than simply another bloated and maddening bureaucracy, it becomes more human, not more divine. The sense that I get is that Kafka was attempting to create a critique of organized religion, not specifically an argument for Kierkegaard’s or Dostoevsky’s more radical and mystical faith.
    
    Beyond this, The Castle seeks to recreate the sense of vertigo that man experiences if he truly tries to find some grounding for his existence. Kafka provides the reader with world for which the only foundation is a complex tangle of lies that everyone (or most everyone) has agreed to give the force of their belief: the world as a bureaucracy with no one at the top, marching blindly into some unknown, unplanned future. I imagine an unmanned combine harvester making a reckless path through fields of humanity who are harvested for nothing.
    
    In this regard, The Castle is a nearly perfect Modernist novel, expressing so well the collapse of meaning and any hoped-for destiny which washed over Europe after WWI and II. It’s a shame it wasn’t finished. I had known this before starting, but I’d assumed that it simply meant that there might be some holes in the narrative at certain points, but no, the plot itself simply evaporates mid-sentence on page 275: “She spoke with difficulty, it was hard to understand her, but what she said”
    
    So ends the work of a truly remarkable man.

    <b>Author: Haemin Sunim</b><br>
    <b>Publish Date: 7February 2017</b><br>By offering helpful anecdotes and stories through eight chapters, Haemin Sunim takes his readers on a journey of self-discovery. He provides spiritual advice regarding various aspects of everyday living, whether this may be overcoming the workplace's struggles or finding one's existential purpose. Sunim emphasizes the importance of creating deep and meaningful relationships with others and ourselves, ultimately showing us that when we slow down, we get to see the world in a much more positive and meaningful way.

    The book starts with a prologue of the author's journey as a monk trying to help people overcome their daily struggles. His philanthropy eventually served as the inspiration for Sunim to write this book. In each of its eight chapters, Sunim talks about some reflections he has learned as a monk and gives some advice when it comes to dealing with the different aspects of life.In the first chapter, Sunim talks about the illusion of thinking that the mind and the world are separate entities. As he states, the boundary between the mind and the world is thin, porous, and ultimately illusory. How we view the mind is ultimately limited to our experiences in the world, as our realities as human beings are not necessarily the whole universe in its entirety but the small part that we choose to zero on. As he mentions, "the world has never complained about how busy it is." So when onefeels overwhelmed with the stresses in life, they are not necessarily helpless to the situation at hand. For when you let your mind rest, the world rests with you.In the next chapter, Sunim talks about the importance of emotions, particularly the so-called "negative" ones. Often, we get caught up with the idea of "managing our negative emotions" and "suppressing our negative feelings" instead of what Sunim states as befriending them for what they are. The first step in better understanding our negative emotions in the hopes of resolving them has to do with the linguistic labels that we put with these emotions (e.g., "hate," "anger"). Once we can separate the labels from the feeling itself, we get to see that energy morph into something else. Although subtle, when we can separate the label's emotion, the raw energy behind these emotions gets to change, but the "label" ultimately stays the same. When we observe our emotions rather than be subsumed in them, we see that these negative emotions are only temporary and not the defining characteristic of our lives. He states that we should not fight with our emotions but observe and befriend them for what they are.We then reach the third chapter of the book, which talks about the concept of passion and the pitfalls that can come with it. In this chapter, Sunim talks about his experiences as a professor in a liberal arts college in Massachusetts. During his first semester of teaching, Sunim would be overzealous in giving out homework and readings for his students. The philosophy behind it was simple: the more they do, the more they would ultimately learn. This backfired for him, as some students would stop doing the assigned work and not come to class altogether. After this blow to his ego, he realized that the students had other things to attend to. Once he struck a balance with the amount of work he gave, the students began to gain more interest in his class. With this, he learned something important about our eagerness. We often mistake the idea of effectiveness with enthusiasm, as we get blinded by our ideals of what we want and neglect the people around us. It is through tempering our overflowing passion that we get to work harmoniously with others. Only then do we get to share our passions successfully with others.
